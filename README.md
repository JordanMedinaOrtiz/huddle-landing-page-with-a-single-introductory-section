  This project is a responsive implementation of the "Huddle Landing Page with a Single Introductory Section" from Frontend Mentor. It was created to improve and reinforce my knowledge of semantic HTML, CSS architecture using the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, and layout techniques with Flexbox. This beginner-friendly challenge was the perfect opportunity to build a clean two-column layout while following best practices in frontend development.
